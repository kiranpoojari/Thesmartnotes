            <h1>Polymer Science - The Smart Notes</h1>
            <p>Polymers are large molecules made up of repeating subunits known as monomers. They are found in nature and can also be synthesized artificially. Polymer Science is a branch of chemistry that studies the synthesis, structure, properties, and applications of polymers. These materials are used in industries such as packaging, automotive, healthcare, and construction.</p>

            <h2>What are Polymers?</h2>
            <p>Polymers are macromolecules consisting of repeating units linked together by covalent bonds. They can be classified based on their structure, properties, and sources.</p>

            <h3>Types of Polymers:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>🔹 <strong>Natural Polymers</strong> – Found in nature (e.g., proteins, cellulose, rubber).</li>
                <li>🔹 <strong>Synthetic Polymers</strong> – Man-made polymers like polyethylene, polystyrene, and nylon.</li>
                <li>🔹 <strong>Thermoplastics</strong> – Can be melted and reshaped multiple times.</li>
                <li>🔹 <strong>Thermosetting Polymers</strong> – Hard and rigid materials that cannot be remelted.</li>
                <li>🔹 <strong>Biodegradable Polymers</strong> – Environmentally friendly alternatives used in medical and packaging industries.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Polymers are an essential part of modern materials science, contributing to innovation in medicine, engineering, and sustainability.</p>
