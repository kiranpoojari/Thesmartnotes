        <h2>Introduction to Differential Equations</h2>
        <p class="left-align">
            **Differential Equations** are mathematical equations that relate a function with its derivatives. 
            They are essential for modeling real-world phenomena such as population growth, motion of objects, electrical circuits, 
            heat conduction, and fluid dynamics. Differential equations are classified into **ordinary differential equations (ODEs)** and 
            **partial differential equations (PDEs)** based on the number of variables involved.
        </p>

        <h2>Types of Differential Equations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>First-Order Differential Equations:</strong> Involves the first derivative of the function.</li>
            <li><strong>Second-Order & Higher-Order Equations:</strong> Contains second or higher derivatives.</li>
            <li><strong>Linear vs. Nonlinear Equations:</strong> Linear equations have terms that are only first-degree, while nonlinear equations involve powers or products of the function and its derivatives.</li>
            <li><strong>Partial Differential Equations (PDEs):</strong> Involves functions of multiple variables and their partial derivatives.</li>
            <li><strong>Homogeneous & Non-Homogeneous Equations:</strong> Homogeneous equations have zero on one side, while non-homogeneous equations contain non-zero terms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications of Differential Equations</h2>
        <p>Differential equations play a crucial role in multiple fields:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Physics:</strong> Newtonâ€™s Laws of Motion, Thermodynamics, and Electromagnetism.</li>
            <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Electrical circuits, Control Systems, and Mechanical Vibrations.</li>
            <li><strong>Economics:</strong> Growth Models, Investment Analysis, and Optimization.</li>
            <li><strong>Biology:</strong> Population Growth Models and Epidemic Spread.</li>
            <li><strong>Computer Science:</strong> Machine Learning Models and Artificial Intelligence Algorithms.</li>
        </ul>
